Practise questions about arrays in Python


Question 1

Write a simple program to manipulate lists. Start the program with two lists:

lows = [3, 5, 7, 9]
highs = [11, 13, 15, 17, 19]

Have your program do the following tasks (note that there is a simple list function that will help you do each one)
1 Print out the length of each list
2 Append the value 21 to highs
3 Reverse the order of highs
4 Extend lows with highs and print the result to check it worked
5 Check if 25 is in the extended list and print yes or no depending on the answer
6 Sort the list and print it again to check that it worked


Question 2

numbers = ['100', '200', '50', '8']

Using the built-in max function find the maximum value in numbers. Decide what you think it will be and then test your result. 


Question 3

crazy = ['chickens', 'Donald Trump', 43]

These are Python's list functions, which do you expect to work on crazy? Check you are correct by writing some code

append
clear
copy
count
extend
index
insert
pop
remove
reverse
sort


N.B. len and max are built into Python and so are called by passing them the list, e.g. len(stuff) but the functions above are list functions that are called on a list, e.g. stuff.clear()


Question 4

There are two syntax errors in the program in fibonacci.py. Can you find them and fix them?
